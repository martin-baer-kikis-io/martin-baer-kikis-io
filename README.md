- 👋 Hi, I’m @martin-baer at kikis-io
- 👀 I’m interested in sport in later life, food and the typical laundry list of ehthusiums, obsessions and habits that update themselves in most of us on a dialy schedule.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about a world that has more than doubled in population since I was twenty, and the irrevockable changes it has stamped on beloved haunts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-toad.com.
- 📫 How to reach me martin.baer@kikis.io.
