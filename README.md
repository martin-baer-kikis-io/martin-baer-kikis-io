- 👋 Hi, I’m @martin-baer at kikis-io
- 👀 I’m interested in creating an RPA solution that can fit into a normal Linux CICD process.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about open source from the production side, rather than as a user or contributor.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-toad.com.
- 📫 How to reach me martin.baer@kikis.io.
